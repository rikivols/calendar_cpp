# Calendar

We have an application calendar, which stores events. Every event has: event id (autogenerated), datetime of start,
datetime of end (not for recurring events), place of the event, attendees, tags, notes.
We have 2 types of events:
1. Simple event - happens only one time, doesn't repeat
2. Recurring event - has start, happens every day from the start datetime, doesn't have end

Calendar also allows:
- Import/Export from its own CSV-like format
- Add event
- Move event by X amount of hours
- Remove event
- Find event by: date before/after, place, attendees, tags. Allows to search by combinations of multiple attributes,
  thanks to the logical operator AND / OR. We can have all the attributes at the same time, but the logical operator
  has to be only of one type. We allow to export the results.
- Display events, modes: daily, weekly, monthly. We can also list through the pages of the display mode. (previous page,
  next page)
- Solve conflicts when adding a new event if they arise
